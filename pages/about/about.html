     <p> This website is designed to navigate political candidates.<br>
      Not everything has been fully developed in the frontend.<br></p>

      <p>What works: all candidates are displayed under the Candidates link.<br> 
      Add candidate works. The router works for most parts but but more <br>
      time is needed to understand how the pathvariable functions.<br> 
      I was however not able to finish: edit candidate and delete candidate.<br> 
      Sort candidate after party should have been an easy task but is not done.<br></p>

    <p>Its been wonderful almost 18 hours without anything more than a pee break.<br>
      I would suggest you break this nonsens into two days 12 hours each, <br>
      or make this only 12 hours.</p>

      <p>Cheers Snorri.</p>
